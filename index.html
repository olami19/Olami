            <p>- Never marry him/her because of love ONLY. i didnt know how it was in the olden days, but these days, many marriages that went for ONLY love have collapse. You need more than love to sail through the waters of marriage. Maturity, Patience, Understanding and Prayer must be predominant.</p>

            <p>- Happiness is within, never look for it outwardly. Relax, the happiness you need in your marriage is the one you bring in. If you think all you need to be happy is from your spouse, you will be disappointed. We all have time that we need to talk to ourselves and God.</p>

            <p>- Never go for money oooo. Retrenchment can occur anytime. Go for someone you can put resources together and bring something out of nothing. Building the wealth with one's spouse comes with some kind of confidence.</p>
